# About Me

My name is Michael Brown. I'm a 30ish doctoral candidate in theoretical physics, a husband of eight years and counting, a father to two [budgerigars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar) (although the paternity test seemed dodgy to me) and an **amateur** writer, theologian, photographer, musician (lapsed), gamer, programmer and liberal Jesus-motivated social justice slackivist. I'm based in north Queensland, Australia, though I'm originally from the United States of America.

## Physics
In terms of physics work I consider myself a quantum field theorist. Quantum field theory is an enormous field, full of amazing discoveries and, despite being a century old, having many active research frontiers. The main areas where it is applied are high energy particle physics, cosmology and many body theory in condensed matter systems. I have a BSc. (Hons) in Physics and am currently studying for a Ph.D. I also have a [ResearchGate profile](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Brown31/).

If you want to get a taste of quantum field theory and you have something like two years of an undergraduate physics degree under you belt (and substantial self-motivation) then I heartily recommend Anthony Zee's [Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Theory-Nutshell-Edition-nutshell/dp/0691140340/). If your physics is rusty (or absent) but you're still curious and want accurate but accessible reading then try the articles on [Matt Strassler's blog](http://profmattstrassler.com/). After Strassler's blog articles I would recommend [The Theoretical Minimum series](http://theoreticalminimum.com/) by Leonard Susskind. It is pitched at the level of "people who know, or once knew, a bit of algebra and calculus, but are more or less beginners" and covers much of modern physics.

### Ph.D
My own thesis topic is "*Nonequilibrium Techniques in Quantum Gauge Theories*", looking at possible ways to get an analytical handle on the violent phase transition processes that may have happened in the first seconds after the big bang, and providing an independent check on calculations of the sort used to study *electroweak baryogenesis*. I'll probably write at length about these things at some point.

### BSc. Honours
The topic of my honours thesis was "*Effects of \\(f(R)\\) Gravity on the Gravitational Bound States of Ultra-cold Neutrons: A Laboratory Scale Detection Technique for Dark Energy?*" ([pdf](\documents\mjb-hons-thesis-marked-version.pdf) 1.98 MB) where I examined whether an experiment of the kind performed by the [GRANIT collaboration](http://www.ill.eu/?id=13447) at ILL in Grenoble could measure the small violations of Einstein's theory of gravity predicted by in-vogue models of dark energy. (The short answer is: no - through no fault of the experimenters. The models are slippery.) To do this requires solving the models to figure out what they predict for the gravitational field inside the experiment, then to study the quantum motion of neutrons in that gravitational field and comparing that to the predictions of Einstein's theory and seeing if the difference is larger than the experimental sensitivity.

The experiment itself is incredible - one of the most remarkable accomplishments I've ever heard of. It is sensitive to energy level shifts of 0.01 pico-electron-volts! To put that in perspective: 0.01 peV is to the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito as one drop is to about [one hundred and fifty barrels of oil](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281.6%C3%9710^-7+joules+%2F+.01+picoeV%29^%281%2F3%29+*+volume+of+a+drop+of+water+in+bbl+oil)! The remarkable sensitivity of this experiment is only possible thanks to the huge difference in strength between the neutron's strong *nuclear* interactions and weak *electromagnetic* interactions, and the ability of the experimenters to machine an exquisitely perfect mirror to bounce the neutrons on.
