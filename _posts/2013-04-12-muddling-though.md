title: Muddling Through
---

I'm making peace with the fact that I'll likely never be able to predict the
pronounciation of slavic names based on the spelling. I'm learning dribs and
drabs from listening to my supervisor. For instance: guess how you say Walecka...

It's pronounced *Valesha*. Get that? Good.

On a completely different topic: When I need to decompress I try to make happy kerbals.

It's not always that easy. :-)
