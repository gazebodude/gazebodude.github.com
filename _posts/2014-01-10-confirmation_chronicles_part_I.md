A Ph.D works nothing like an undergraduate degree, at least at my home
institution (although it's changing to become more similar in some ways).
You don't get a subject plan divided into nice semester blocks.
There are no tutorial sessions, homework assignments, exams or credit
points to test your progress. You have no teachers handing you the material.
Indeed nobody *can*: by the end of your Ph.D you are expected to know
more about your topic than anybody else in the world. You don't get that
from a book.

So what do you get?

A (three + however-many-you-can-wrangle-from-the-reviewers) year block
of time to become the best in the world at *something*, with proposals,
reports, timelines, reviews, seminars (that you deliver) and committee
meetings to keep you on track.

You start as a "provisional" candidate and your immediate goal is to
fulfill the requirements of confirmation of candidature:

1. A costed, structured project proposal with timeline, methodology
 acceptable to an expert independent review, and a provisional publication
 plan.
2. A substative written scholarly work, usually (though different
 disciplines have different standards) a literature review.
3. A 30-40 minute seminar with an additional 30 minute question time,
 given to the candidature committee and school.

The graduate research school gives you six months to do all this, and if you
don't they can ask you to "show cause" why your candidature should not be
terminated. It is really up to the faculty to pursue things if they stretch on
past the nominal deadline though, and most people in my school seem to do their
confirmation towards the end of their first year. I'm getting serious about it
around to 10-11 month mark.

I have done the substantive written work (at least to the satisfaction of my
advisors), which is less like a literature review and more like an honours
thesis with some original calculations and coming in at a whopping 89 pages
(1 page abstract & TOC + 80 pages content + 80 references). I'm now working on
my project proposal, which involves (in part) answering the following questions:

## Project Summary
> Describe in plain English what you are proposing to do and why (maximum 100 words).
> The project summary should be written in a manner that is accessible to any
> intelligent reader.

Here is my first stab at a summary:

> The Large Hadron Collider and other experiments have opened a new window on
> nature at the smallest scales, and long standing speculations are now being
> put to the test. A popular idea about the origin of matter, electroweak
> baryogenesis (EWBG), is among them. Accurate predictions are crucial for testing
> this, but EWBG calculations are notoriously difficult. I will look at extending
> promising new techniques, which have only been tried on "toy" models, to more
> realistic theories with the goal of providing an accurate and independent check
> on existing calculations, so that EWBG can be definitively tested in the next decade.

I think that's alright. The next one is where I'm struggling.

## Background and Significance (Max 4 pages)
> Your project proposal should answer the following questions:
> 1. What is the scholarly context or theoretical background of the problem you are studying?
> 2. Where are the knowledge gaps and why are they important?
> 3. How will your work extend and add to the work that has been published already?
> 4. What are your research questions/hypotheses?

This is pretty much covered in my report. My 89 page report.

*Redaction time!*

So far I've managed to get it down to a smidge over 6 pages (+ 45 references).
That's more than a factor of thirteen reduction, but I have another factor of
two-ish to go and that one is the toughest!

## Objectives of Your Research or Creative Work	(Max 1 page)
> Project proposals differ in their formats in different disciplines and the
> language may change.  Some proposals use aims and objectives; some use research
> questions; and others use hypotheses.  Use the vocabulary that is customary
> for your discipline.  Consult with your Advisory Panel as to the norm for your
> discipline.  The objectives form the basis for the activities of the project and
> also serve as the basis for the evaluation of the project at your Confirmation of
> Candidature.

... and this one I'm really not too sure about.
