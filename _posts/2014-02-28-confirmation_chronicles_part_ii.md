Well, too long since the last update. Nothing much has been happening here.
My principal advisor is away until mid-March so I won't be able to give my
seminar until he gets back, but my proposal is basically done and my seminar is
tentatively scheduled. Now I'm working on _actual_ project work (*gasp*
*shock*!) and my talk.

In the meantime enjoy the tweaked project summary which now reads:

> The Large Hadron Collider and other experiments have opened a new window on nature at the smallest scales, and long standing speculations are now being put to the test. A popular idea about the origin of matter, electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), is among them. Accurate predictions are crucial for testing this, but EWBG calculations are notoriously difficult. I will look at extending promising new techniques, which have only been tried on 'toy' models, to more realistic theories. The result would be new ways of performing calculations in quantum field theories, with many potential applications including extracting accurate predictions from EWBG models.

The focus is changing more towards some general QFT techniques rather than
baryogenesis specifically.

To that end have a look at these Feynman diagrams. If you know anything about
QFT this might seem like a rather eclectic set to call special attention to.
Much more about this later.
