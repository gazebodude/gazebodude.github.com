Today I introduce a new series for this blog. (I haven't forgotten the other
series on the go. Rather I figure that if I keep enough balls in the air
eventually some of them will drop near the vicinity of the goal.) We're going to
look at all of the Nobel prizes granted in physics _in chronological order_.
We'll read the lectures, look for any biographical details we can find and try
to piece together some kind of account of the historical development. The
point being to get better acquainted with the history of the subject and the often
subtle and confusing nature of scientific progress: the false starts, blind
alleys, lucky breaks and --- yes --- politics that often get white-washed from the
textbooks.

Now I'm not a trained historian. I'm doing this as a hobby project. So I make no
claims to get everything right. Please give feedback via the comments:
elaborations on the historical context, (constructive) criticism, correction,
references etc. are all very much appreciated!

Let's get started.

## 1901: Wilhelm Conrad R&#x00F6;ntgen

We know them as "X-rays" now. In fact that is the term R&#x00F6;ntgen coined and
preferred himself, though for a time others referred to them as R&#x00F6;ntgen rays.

While studying cathode rays (we now call these electrons) in his lab on 8 Nov 1895,
R&#x00F6;ntgen noticed that a flourescent screen was glowing that should not have been
affected by the cathode rays. He set about exploring the phenomenon and quickly
ruled out cathode rays as the source: the new form of radiation was highly
penetrating and could expose photographic plates. He called them x-rays because
of their unknown nature. One of the photos he took was of his wife's hand with
wedding ring:

The remarkable photo --- first of its kind, remember --- indirectly found its
way to a newspaper man by 4 Jan 1896 and "all hell broke loose" as
R&#x00F6;ntgen describes it. It was front page news around the world within a
week and x-rays were entering real medical use within months. This is an
astonishing pace from discovery to adoption, especially in a pre-blogosphere
world! Of course people were less rigorous about "evidence based medicine".
Now you would have to study the potential adverse effects for years before even
thinking of a human trial! (I won't say that's a *bad* thing, necessarily.)

R&#x00F6;ntgen himself shied away from the spotlight. He did not give a Nobel
lecture and in fact he even withdrew from research on x-rays. He seems to have
enjoyed a quiet life after the prize until his death in 1923 from intestinal
cancer (whether this is related to x-ray exposure I care not to speculate).

I would like to close by mentioning that I owe R&#x00F6;ntgen a personal debt of
gratitude. Not only have I had my fair share of medical x-rays, but they also
put bread on the table. My wife is a radiation therapist and for her the use of
x-rays in the treatment of cancer is a daily reality. The operating principle of
modern medical linacs (="linear accelerators") is *no different* from the
cathode ray tubes of R&#x00F6;ntgen's day, only their degree of sophistication,
control and safety is incredibly advanced. Modern systems image while delivering
treatment and adaptively control beam shape to the millimetre level, also
adjusting the beam intensity to minimise damage to healthy tissue while delivering
high dose to tumour. My wife's own research has to do with improved targeting of
prostate tumours as they move during and between treatment sessions.

I haven't even talked about the uses of x-rays in astronomy and materials
science, which have opened new windows on the world both in the large and the small.
These are all wonderful things. I wonder how much of this R&#x00F6;ntgen
foresaw as he worked in that dimly lit laboratory.
