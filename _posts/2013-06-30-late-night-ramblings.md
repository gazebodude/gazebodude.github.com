What would one do for love? Nothing means more to me in this world than my dear
wife, who is this moment sleeping peacefully in our bed. Yet I sit awake in the
dark, fretting over things that I cannot control, when I would love nothing more
than to snuggle with her and forget everything but her warmth.

I am anxious. I compulsively worry. If I have nothing substantial to worry about
I invent something. At the moment I have a sore tooth and a bit of swollen gum,
so naturally I am going to die. Of course I *am* going to die, somehow, someday.
I don't like thinking about that, and worry certainly isn't going to help. But
what can I do about it? I'll go to the dentist in a few days at the next available
slot, and it probably won't be the end of the world. But of course it may be...
This is how I talk to myself. I'm like a Woody Allen character without the funny.

Remarkably I'm not actually afraid of dentists, in much the same way that I'm
not afraid of snakes. But I still watch the footpath. I've nearly tread on a
snake before. Stepping on a dentist would just be awful.

As I laid in bed I began asking myself "have I had a good life?" Then before
the brooding got well underway another voice came in and said, "I've lived the
life I have lived and that's that. This introspection is pointless unless it
leads me to change things." Fair point. So what would I change?

I would write more,
  watch less;
Walk more,
  eat less;
Read more,
  brood less;
Talk more,
  hide less;
Pray more,
  worry less.

I would learn to be present in the moment, to *live*. To love, be awestruck,
experience wonder.

I'm a physicist so I should have no excuse for boredom. This universe is fucking
awesome. I'm a Christian so I should have no excuse for depression. Love wins.
I'm a member of the last generation to remember life before the world wide web.
I cannot say "there is nothing new under the sun."

Yes the sucky stuff will still be there. I am loaded with doubts, worries, troubles.
I feel pains in my body that any other person, should our minds somehow switch
places, probably would not notice. I have a nervous disposition. Is there something
wonky with my [HPA axis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis)? Probably.

I guess the point of this is to say that I'm looking for balance in my life.

By the way, on the \\(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\\) chance that you are wondering what is happening
with this blog: I have been slow with posting, but new stuff is happening on a
topic branch. Hopefully an exciting new merge will happen soon.
