> Did Jesus require a good or service from anyone to prevent them from starving? He didn't. Did he request payment for his miracles? Never. He never told us not to expect to be paid for work, and of course we should be: but we should also recognize that work itself, that the economy and the state themselves, are to be placed in service of the responsibility we have to one another. If we can use any of those things, therefore, to meet our responsibilities, then we should do so.

> There are, of course, completely reasonable situations that exist between free-market capitalist situations like the kind Shapiro imagines and 'full communism.' We're free to be creative here, and to use our intelligence and creativity to come up with practices that serve our responsibilities. But our intention itself - that is, the expression of human will, unencumbered by any outside reality - is not the purpose of humankind, and to try to create a pale and vitiated 'freedom' by dissolving our responsibilities to one another is to turn totally away from God.
