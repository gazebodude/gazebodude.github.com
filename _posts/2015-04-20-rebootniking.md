Hello there! It's time to reboot this blog.
It went offline for a while because my Github account changed and I never
got around to updating everything.

* The site URL has changed, reflecting the change in my Github account. Old posts are obviously still available.
* I'll continue the weekly series that were going previously, with a liberal interpretation of 'weekly'.
* I now have a twitter account [@MikeBsPhysics](http://twitter.com/MikeBsPhysics). Yes, I am aware there are several possible interpretations of the name:
  1. Mike Brown's Physics
  2. Mike, Bachelor of Science in Physics
  3. Mike's Bull$hit Physics.

  The intended interpretation is the first, but I'm perfectly happy with the ambiguity. Mike Brown is just too common a name to settle for obvious Twitter handles.
* A bit of Ph.D progression: I have two papers (one published, one under review). You can see them on the [arXiv preprint server](http://arxiv.org/a/brown_m_3.html) or on [my Researchgate profile](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Brown31/).
* New content coming soon! :ok_hand:
