## Time to start this thing again...

Well it's been half a year since my last post. One thing leads to another... and I do my usual thing of dropping a side project for a while. But it's time to go again. Part of the reason for taking this back up again is this:

That is a brand new Canon EOS 70D with EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM and EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lenses and 580EX II Speedlight flash. I've always had an interest in photography - I remember playing with exposure and shutter speed settings back when you had to record your settings in a notebook and wait for a week to get the developed film back - but this is a serious step up in kit for me. It's my first **real** DSLR, and I've been loving it for the past few weeks. So I'm going to turn this into a bit of a photoblog (along with writings). Because the web \\(\neq\\) Facebook + Instagram. :)
