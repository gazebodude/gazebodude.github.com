##  Intro

If you haven't read Edwin Abbott's
*[Flatland: A Romance of Many
Dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland)* go and read it now. It is
now in the public domain so it's free online, and your geek cred will go up by
500 points. Reading it as a kid it is a fun and mind-expanding adventure into
the world of creatures of different dimensionality. Reading it as an adult it is
a brilliant satire of Victorian society. I remember experiencing it as both.

As a physicist I'm taken with the idea of imagining what the world would be like
without a third dimension to climb around in. I'm also inspired with the great
work Greg Egan has done with his
[Orthogonal](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html)
series: taking hard sci-fi to its limit by working out what physics *really
would be like* in his imagined (Euclidean rather than Minkowskian) world. The
results are both strangely familiar to and strangely different from our world, and 
rich enough to provide the backdrop for a meaningful story. So with this series
I would like to take a stab at a similar thing for Flatland.

What would physics be like if the world were two dimensional? (Or 2+1
dimensional, really, including time as a dimension.) There are some remarkable
consequences from this simple change. For example, we will find that:

* There is no such thing as a long range gravitational force.
* All attractive forces are *confined*: any two particles which are attracted to
  each other are *permanently* bound. There is no pulling them apart, and at
  large enough scales all you ever see are very weakly interacting neutral
  composites.
* A large class of phase transitions are impossible.
* Permanent vortices can exist.
* Particles can have any amount of spin, and can have "topological order" -
  properties of the whole system greater than the sum of its parts, and stable
  against outside disturbances - due to quantum weirdness.

It's going to be hard going to get any decent story prospects, but the journey
itself might be a little fun. And who knows... there may be life here. But it's
definitely not life as we know it.

## Mechanics

Not much happens to ordinary mechanics when you get rid of a dimension. The same
conservation laws still work. The main difference is that angular momentum is a
scalar.
